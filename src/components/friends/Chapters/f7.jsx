        <li>Be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themselves</li>
        <li>Many people fail to listen attentively they are so much more concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open</li>
        <li>If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you here is the recipe</li>
        <li>Never listen to anyone for long, Talk incessantly about yourself, If you have an idea while the other person is talking donâ€™t wait for him to finish, Bust right in and interrupt at the middle of the sentence</li>
        <li>Bad listeners are just bores intoxicated in their own ego and drunk with the sense of their own importance</li>
        <li>If you aspire to be a good conversationalist be an active listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions the other person will love answering</li>
        <li>Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems</li>
      </ul>
