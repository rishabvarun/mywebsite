        <li>Why talk about what you want? That is childish, absurd. You are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. Likewise, rest of the world is interested in what they want</li>
        <li>Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire. First arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way</li>
        <li>Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak pause and ask yourself “How can I make the person want to do it?”</li>
        <li>People who can put themselves in the place of other people, understand the workings of their minds need never worry about what the future has in store for them.</li>
