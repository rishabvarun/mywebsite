      <ul>
        <li>Give honest and sincere appreciation</li>
        <li>There is only one way to get anybody to do anything: Make the other person want to do it</li>
        <li>Deepest urge in human nature - “Desire to be important”</li>
        <li>Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality</li>
        <li>Best way to make people work is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that kills the ambitions of a person than criticisms from superiors</li>
        <li>People crave for appreciation, give it to them once in a while</li>
        <li>Some people, are so hungry for appreciation that they will eat anything just as hungry man will eat grass and fish worms</li>
        <li>In the long run flattery will do more harm than good</li>
        <li>The difference between flattery and appreciation - one is sincere, one is universally admired, one is unselfish</li>
        <li>When someone is kind to you appreciate it</li>
        <li>Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for</li>
        <li>What applies to professionals applies doubly to workers, families and friends</li>
        <li>Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will rose beacons on your next visit</li>
