      <ul>
        <li>A man who fights for what he wants, never gives up, eventually achieves his wildest dreams</li>
        <li>Fame and success did not make him a better person, nor was it by becoming a better person he became famous and successful</li>
        <li>Self improvement and success often occur together but that doesn’t mean they are actually the same thing</li>
        <li>You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything all the time by media</li>
        <li>Giving too many fucks causes your life to be attached to superficial and fake to dedicate your life to chasing a mirage of happiness or satisfaction</li>
        <li>The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more - its about giving a fuck about less what is true, immediate and important</li>
        <li>Our culture today which is driven by success, fame and proving that my life is better than yours has bred a whole generation of people who believe that having these negative experiences is not okay - anxiety, fear and guilt</li>
        <li>The world is totally fucked and it has always been that way and always will be</li>
        <li>The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience and paradoxically the acceptance of ones negative experience is a positive experience</li>
        <li>Pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place</li>
        <li>The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel</li>
        <li>The more you desperately want to be sexy and feel desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance</li>
        <li>The more you desperately want to be happy and loved the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you</li>
        <li>Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience</li>
        <li>To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain, pain you feel today is the strength you feel tomorrow. If you don’t give any fucks about pain you will feel unstoppable</li>
        <li>Whenever you give a fuck about something, ask immediately what action are you doing about it?</li>
        <li>The subtle art of not giving a fuck is a difficult task and takes a lot of discipline - but its a worthwhile effort.</li>
        <li>Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, its about comfortable with being different</li>
        <li>Whether you realise it or not you are always choosing what to give a fuck about</li>
        <li>When we feel its not okay for things to suck sometimes we unconsciously start blaming ourselves</li>
      </ul>
