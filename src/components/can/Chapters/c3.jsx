      <ul>
       <li>Achievers set high expectations from themselves and they realise that sacrifices will be necessary to achieve their goals</li>
       <li>When others are relaxing or taking breaks the achiever continues hustling developing their gameplan and looking for opportunities</li>
       <li>You tell a child “NO” several times but they refuse to give in and finally you agree to their pleas. As adults we have lost this determination</li>
       <li>Rising above average and achieving will not be easy</li>
       <li>If you want your life to change, then you must change</li>
       <li>Even being slightly better than average can dramatically separate achievers from non achievers</li>
       <li>By taking responsibility for your weakness, you will be able to change it</li>
       <li>Whatever you decide to go after you must make an absolute commitment</li>
       <li>You must commit yourself to true standards that you consistently stand by, regardless of their difficulty - standards that you continuously uphold even when no one else is watching</li>
       <li>It is easier to lower you standards than to raise them, it is easier to go along with the masses than to separate yourself from them. Whenever there is doubt between the easier path and the one that requires you to stretch get in the habit of stretching</li>
       <li>If you are giving all that you have but are miserable at your job and feel you deserve more, then leave. Don’t hang around until you are forced out - life is too short</li>
       <li>The art of record breaking is the ability to take more out of yourself than you have got. This is the level of commitment that is needed to achieve. If it were anything less more people would have been achieving their goals and dreams</li>
