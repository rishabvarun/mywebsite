        <li>Begin today by thinking about your own dreams and the future that desperately awaits your arrival</li>
        <li>Stop worrying about what others are thinking</li>
        <li>Stop dreaming, thinking and talking about success and start achieving it</li>
        <li>The most important ingredient that determines whether a person succeeds is the power of believing in himself</li>
        <li>Ultimately its not the external circumstances that limit you: It is you, your negative thoughts, comfort zones, self defeating habits, poor strategies, blame lists and failure to continuously educate and grow</li>
        <li>Your past doesn’t have to equal your future, you can change your life today</li>
        <li>Achieving is not merely about accumulating life's pleasantries it is about becoming all that you possibly can and then contributing in a positive way</li>
        <li>Stop seeking approval of others and begin achieving your goals and living your dreams</li>
      </ul>
