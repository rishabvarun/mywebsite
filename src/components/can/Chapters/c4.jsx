      <li>The biggest room in the world is the room for improvement</li>
      <li>Most people want the interest before they make the investment</li>
      <li>The secret for the success in life is for a man to be ready for the opportunity when it comes. If a person has not prepared himself sufficiently when the opportunity comes its too late</li>
      <li>If you invest your time now, the future dividends would pay multiple rewards</li>
      <li>If a person spends one hour a day every on the same subject for five years then that person will be an expert on that subject</li>
      <li>If procrastination, laziness, overindulgence or bad temper is limiting your effectiveness then work hard to replace those bad habits with good ones.</li>
      <li>Improving yourself requires self discipline, its is not always easy. There will be times when achievement requires you to do things that you donâ€™t like to do. Discipline however will help you stay on track</li>
      <li>You must make deliberate efforts to  grow and change in specific alignment with your goals</li>
      <li>The mind likes what is the same but it learns from what is different </li>
      <li>It is far more effective to make the internal changes first if you want the external things to change</li>
      <li>Like a muscle when knowledge skills and habits go unused they dissipate</li>
      <li>When people continually work on themselves they become sharper in their thinking</li>
      <li>Self improvement leads not only to achievment but also a greater sense of fullfillment and satisfaction</li>
