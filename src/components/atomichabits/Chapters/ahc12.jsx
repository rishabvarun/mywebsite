        <li>Every action requires a certain amount of energy, the more energy it requires the less likely it is to occur</li>
        <li>Trying to pump up motivation to stick with a hard habit is very difficult and requires lot of effort</li>
        <li>The key is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to make things that payoff in the long run</li>
        <li>Rather than trying to overcome the friction in life, you can try and reduce it</li>
        <li>When we remove the points of friction that sap our energy we can achieve more with less effort</li>
        <li>Increase the friction of bad habits and reduce the friction of good habits</li>
