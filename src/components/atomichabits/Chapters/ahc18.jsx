      <ul>
        <li>The strength of genetics is also their weakness</li>
        <li>Genes cannot be easily changed means they provide a powerful advantage in favourable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavourable circumstances</li>
        <li>The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying</li>
        <li>Sometimes motion is useful but it will never produce an outcome by itself</li>
        <li>Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular</li>
        <li>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favour is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful</li>
        <li>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and progress is a struggle</li>
        <li>When habit is easy, you are more likely to be succesful and you are more likely to feel satisfied</li>
        <li>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hardwork, they clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realise our strengths we know where to spend our time and energy</li>
        <li>It’s more productive to focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else</li>
        <li>Until you work as hard as the people you admire don’t explain away their success as luck</li>
