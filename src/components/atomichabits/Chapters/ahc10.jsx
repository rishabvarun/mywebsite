      <ul>
        <li>A craving is just a underlying manifestation of a deeper underlying motive</li>
        <li>Your current habits are not the necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face they are just methods you learned to use</li>
        <li>Our behaviour is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves</li>
        <li>Two people can look at a cigarette and one feels the urge to smoke and other is repulsed by the smell.</li>
        <li>The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction.</li>
        <li>Cause of habits is actually the prediction that precedes them</li>
        <li>Desire is the difference between where you are and where you want to be right now</li>
        <li>When emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions</li>
        <li>Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make its seem unattractive</li>
        <li>The specific cravings you feel are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives</li>
        <li>Reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits</li>
        <li>Change “have” to “get”</li>
        <li>I get to wake up early morning, I get to exercise, I get to sleep early to bed</li>
        <li>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them</li>
        <li>It’s not easy but if you can reprogram your predictions you can transform a hard habit to an easy one</li>
