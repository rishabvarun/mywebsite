        <li>The lone wolf dies but the pack survives</li>
        <li>Humans are social creatures - we want to fit in, bond with others, earn the respect and approval of our peers</li>
        <li>We donâ€™t choose our earliest habits it is handed to us by the society we live in</li>
        <li>We imitate habits of 3 groups in particular</li>
        <li>The close (family and friends)</li>
        <li>Our friends and family provides us a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction</li>
        <li>One of the best way to build habits is to join culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior</li>
        <li>If you are surrounded by fit people you are likely to consider working out to be a common habit</li>
        <li>Your culture sets your expectations of whats normal</li>
        <li>The many (the tribe)</li>
        <li>The normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual</li>
        <li>There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group</li>
        <li>The reward of getting accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart or finding the truth.</li>
        <li>Most days we rather be wrong with the crowd than be right ourselves</li>
        <li>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive, when changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe change is very attractive</li>
        <li>The powerful (those with status and prestige)</li>
        <li>Historically a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival and proves to be a more successful mate</li>
        <li>Many of our daily habits are imitations of the people we desire. We try to copy the behaviour of successful people because we desire success ourselves</li>
        <li>Once we fit in we start looking for ways to stand out</li>
      </ul>
