        <li>It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change</li>
        <li>Fastest way to loose weight, Best program to build muscle, Perfect idea for a side hustle</li>
        <li>Motion vs Action - Motion is planning and strategizing. Action is behavior that will deliver an outcome.</li>
        <li>Sometimes motion is useful but it will never produce an outcome by itself</li>
        <li>No matter how many times you talk to a trainer the motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get you the result you’re looking to achieve</li>
        <li>We like motion, because it feels like we are making progress without running the risk of failure</li>
        <li>It doesn’t feel good to fail or be judged publicly so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen</li>
        <li>Biggest reason to avoid action: Want to delay failure</li>
        <li>When preparation becomes a form of procrastination you want to do something</li>      </ul>
