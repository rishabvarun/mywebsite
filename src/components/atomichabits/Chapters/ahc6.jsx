      <ul>
        <li>Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues of good habits are right in front of you</li>
        <li>Most people live in the worlds others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones</li>
        <li>Stop thinking your environment are filled with objects. Start thinking as if they are filled with relationships. Establish relationships with certain objects and connections with locations and environments so that they have postive influences. </li>
        <li>Train yourself to link a particular habit to a particular context. It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues - (Ex: Difficult to go to bed each night if you watch telivision before sleep)</li>
        <li>The most persistent behaviors have multiple cues</li>
        <li>One space one use - Need not be a single room for a particular habit. Try to associate an object with a single usage (Ex: I will use my tablet only for reading). Divide room into activity zones (Chair for reading, bed for sleeping)</li>
