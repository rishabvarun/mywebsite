      <ul>
        <li>Behaviours followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that provide unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated</li>
        <li>Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that led to the reward. Wait a minute - that felt good. What did I do right before that?</li>
        <li>As habits are formed the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on cues that predict success and tune out everything else.</li>
        <li>Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks</li>
        <li>Some people think you have to chose between building habits and attaining freedom. But in reality, those two complement each other (Habits create more free space in brain for other activities)</li>
        <li>Process of building habits 1)Cue 2)Craving 3)Response 4)Reward</li>
        <li>The cue is about noticing the reward and the craving is about wanting the reward</li>
        <li>Rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future</li>
        <li>If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages it will not become a habit</li>
        <li>Without the first three steps a behaviour will never occur without all four a behaviour will never repeat again</li>
      </ul>
