      <ul>
        <li>4th law of behaviour change: Make it satisfying </li>
        <li>While the first three laws are for triggering the action (behaviour) the last law triggers the repetition of the behaviour</li>
        <li>Our goals and habits are usually meant to give long term results but the human brain always goes for instant gratification</li>
        <li>Cardinal rule of behavior change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immedieately punished is avoided</li>
        <li>The consequences of bad habits are delayed but the rewards are immediate - Smoking cigarette, eating junk food</li>
        <li>With good habits its the opposite, the immediate outcome is unenjoyable but the ultimate outcome feels good</li>
        <li>The road less travelled is the road of delayed gratification</li>
        <li>If you’re willing to wait for the rewards you’ll face less competition and often get better rewards</li>
        <li>Success in every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward</li>
        <li>Add a little bit of pleasure to habits that reward in the long run and a little bit of pain to habits that don’t</li>
        <li>The vital thing for a habit to be rewarding — feel successful even if it is in a small way</li>
        <li>In a perfect world, the reward for the habit is the habit itself</li>
        <li>Immediate reinforcement helps to maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for long term rewards to arrive</li>
        <li>Eventually intrinsic rewards like better mood, reduced stress and more energy kicks in you’ll be less concerned with chasing the secondary reward</li>
