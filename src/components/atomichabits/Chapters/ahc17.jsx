        <ul>
        <li>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful</li>
        <li>Pain is an effective teacher. The more immediate and costly a mistake is the more effectively you will learn from it</li>
        <li>Increase the speed of punishment associated with a bad habit. There can’t be a gap between the action and consequences</li>
        <li>We’ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain</li>
        <li>To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action</li>
        <li>Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behaviour</li>
        </ul>
