      <h3 className="title">The surprising power of Atomic Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We all deal with setbacks but  in the long run the quality of our lives depends on the quality of our habits</li>
        <li>Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can lead to a network of strong and broad connections overtime</li>
        <li>A 1% gain each day for a year makes you 37 times better by the end of the year, the same is true otherside</li>
        <li>Need to be more concerned about current trajectory than current results</li>
        <li>Habits appear to make no difference until you cross a threshold and unlock a new level of performance</li>
        <li>Just like the icecube doesnâ€™t melt until it reaches the melting point or the stonemason who breaks the stone after hammering it for the hundred and oneth time, it was not the last hammering which caused the stone to break</li>
        <li>Forget about goals, focus on systems</li>
        <li>Goals are about the results you want to achieve, systems are about the processes that lead to those results</li>
        <li>If you want to achieve success in life forget about goals focus on systems instead</li>
        <li>Goals are good for setting the right direction but systems are best for making progress</li>
        <li>Both winners and losers have the same goal, but it is their system of continuous small improvements that make the winners achieve</li>
        <li>Goals create an either or conflict, which limits happiness</li>
        <li>Goals might make us revert back to our old habits once we achieve them</li>
        <li>True long term thinking is goal-less thinking. It is not about any single achievement it is about endless refinement and continuous improvement</li>
        <li>Just like atoms are building blocks of molecules atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results</li>
        <li>Habits are a double edged sword they can make you or break you</li>
      </ul>
