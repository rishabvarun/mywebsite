      <ul>
        <li>Track them, best way is to use a habit tracker, DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN</li>
        <li>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one</li>
        <li>The mere act of tracking a behaviour can spark the urge to change it</li>
        <li>Most of us have a distorted view of our own behaviour, we think we act better than we do.</li>
        <li>Measurement offers us blindness to our own behaviour and notice what’s really going on each day</li>
        <li>When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself</li>
        <li>The most effective form of motivation is progress, when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path</li>
        <li>Habit tracking provides you a visual proof of your hard work, how far you have come</li>
        <li>Habit tracking can become its own form of reward</li>
        <li>Habit tracking provides us visual proof that you are casting votes to the type of person you wish to become</li>
        <li>The dark side of tracking a behaviour is we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it</li>
        <li>We optimise what we measure, when we choose the wrong measurement we get the wrong behaviour</li>
        <li>In a data driven world we overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft  and difficult to quantify</li>
        <li>Just because you measure something doesn’t mean its the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean its not important </li>
        </ul>
