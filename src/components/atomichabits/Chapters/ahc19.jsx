      <ul>
        <li>The human brain loves challenge but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty</li>
        <li>Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities</li>
        <li>Not too hard, not too easy, just right</li>
        <li>Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is they still find a way to show up despite the feeling of boredom</li>
        <li>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something the more boring and routine it becomes</li>
        <li>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us</li>
        <li>As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy even if the old one was still working</li>
        <li>If youâ€™re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting</li>
        <li>At some point everyone faces this challenge - You will have to fall in love with boredom</li>
        <li>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You will fall in love with boredom</li>
