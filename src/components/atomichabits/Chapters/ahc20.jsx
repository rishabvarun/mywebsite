        <li>Habits are necessary, but not sufficient to mastery</li>
        <li>Habits + Deliberate practice = Mastery</li>
        <li>To become great skills do need to become automatic</li>
        <li>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill and using the new habit as a foundation to the next frontier of your development</li>
        <li>Each habit unlocks the next level of performance itâ€™s an endless cycle</li>
        <li>Worrying too much about every daily choice, is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and loose sight of the bigger picture</li>
        <li>Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance</li>
        <li>You can see the important changes you should make without loosing sight of the bigger pictureYou can see the important changes you should make without loosing sight of the bigger picture</li>
        <li>Redefine yourself so that you keep the important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes</li>
        <li>A lack of self awareness is poison, reflection and review is the antidote</li>
