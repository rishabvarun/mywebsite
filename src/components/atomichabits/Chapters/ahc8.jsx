      <ul>
        <li>2nd law of behavior change - Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is the more likely it is to be habit forming</li>
        <li>Society is filled with highly engineered version of reality that make our world more attractive than our ancestors evolved in</li>
        <li>We have the brains of our ancestors but the temptations that they never had to face</li>
        <li>While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimuli (like present worldly attractions) we can make them more enticing</li>
        <li>Biological signature every habits share - dopamine spike</li>
        <li>Dopamine is not released only when you experience pleasure it is also released when you anticipate it</li>
        <li>The anticipation/desire of an experience often feels better than the attainment of it</li>
        <li>We need to make our habits more attractive because it is the expectation of the reward that makes us to act in the first place</li>
        <li>If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages it will not become a habit</li>
        <li>Without the first three steps a behaviour will never occur without all four a behaviour will never repeat again</li>
