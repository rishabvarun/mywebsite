        <li>Addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment</li>
        <li>Disciplined people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self control. They spend less time in tempting situations</li>
        <li>It’s easier to practice self control when you don’t have to use it often</li>
        <li>Do not wish to create a more disciplined person, create a more disciplined environment</li>
        <li>Bad habits are autocatalytic: The process feeds itself</li>
        <li>Cue induced wanting - An external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Remove such external triggers from your environment</li>
        <li>If you can’t get any work done leave your phone in another room for a few hours</li>
        <li>If you are continuously feeling you are not enough stop using social media that is triggering jealousy and envy</li>
        <li>Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away</li>
        <li>You can break a habit but you are unlikely to forget it</li>
        <li>Self control is a short term strategy not a long term one</li>
        <li>Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing your energy would be better spent optimising your environment.</li>
