        <li>The point is to master the habit of showing up</li>
        <li>The more you ritualise the begining of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things</li>
        <li>Make it easy to start and the rest will follow, make the first action mindless</li>
        <li>One small push is better than not doing it at all</li>
