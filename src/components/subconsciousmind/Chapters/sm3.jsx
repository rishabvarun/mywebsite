      <ul>
        <li>Your subconscious started your heartbeat, controls the circulation of your blood, and regulates your digestion, assimilation and elimination</li>
        <li>You can discover the miracle power of your subconscious mind by plainly stating to your subconscious before sleeping that you wish a certain specific thing accomplished</li>
        <li>There is no sickness or discord when the conscious and subconscious work together harmoniously and peacefully</li>
        <li>How often have you wounded yourself by getting angry, fearful, jealous or vengeful?</li>
        <li>These are poisons that enter your subconscious mind, you were not born with these negative attitudes.</li>
        <li>Feed your subconscious with life gifting thoughts and you will wipe out all the negativity lodged therein</li>
        <li>Be sure to speak to your subconscious with authority and conviction and it will conform to your command</li>
        <li>Your business is with your conscious mind not your subconscious mind</li>
        <li>Just keep your conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best and make sure the thoughts you habitually think are based on whatsoever things are lovely, true, just and of good report</li>
        <li>Begin now to take care of your conscious mind. Knowing in heart that your subconscious mind is always expressing, reproducing and manifesting according to your habitual thinking</li>
        <li>Your thought is action and the reaction is the automatic response of your subconscious mind. Watch your thoughts</li>
