      <ul>
        <li>There are two levels of your mind - Conscious mind (rational level), Subconsciousmind (irrational level)</li>
        <li>You think with your conscious mind and whatever you habitually think sinks to your subconscious mind, which creates according to the nature of your thoughts</li>
        <li>Your subconscious mind is the seat of your emotions and your creative mind.</li>
        <li>If you think evil evil will follow, if you think good good will follow</li>
        <li>You will get a reaction or response from your subconscious mind according to the nature of your thought or idea you hold in your conscious mind</li>
        <li>This law when applied in a negative way is the cause for failure, frustration and unhappiness</li>
        <li>When your habitual thinking is harmonious and constructive, you experience perfect health, success and prosperity</li>
        <li>Whatever you claim and feel as true your subconscious mind will accept and bring forth into your experience</li>
        <li>Negative destructive thoughts continue to work negatively in your subconscious mind and in due time will come forth into outer experience which corresponds with them</li>
        <li>Subconscious mind accepts suggestion irrespective of whether it is true or false. Having once accepted a suggestion it responds to the nature of the suggestion given</li>
        <li>If you have conveyed erroneous concepts to your subconscious mind the sure method of overcoming them is by the repetition of constructive, harmonious thoughts frequently repeated which your subconscious mind accepts</li>
        <li>If you have indulged in fear, worry and other destructive forms of thinking the remedy is to recognise the omnipotence of your subconscious mind and decree freedom, happiness and perfect health</li>
        <li>A suggestion (from another person) cannot impose something on the subconscious mind against the will of the conscious mind</li>
        <li>Your subconscious mind cannot take a joke (donâ€™t give joke suggestions). It takes you at your word</li>
        <li>Physical inertia renders favours mental passivity and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion</li>
        <li>You have the capacity to choose - Choose life, Choose health, Choose happiness</li>
      </ul>
