        <li>Your subconscious mind will follow orders and you will go through life experiencing the lack of these things</li>
        <li>When your conscious mind (little me) is full of FEAR, ANXIETY AND WORRY.</li>
        <li>Your negative emotions engendered in your subconscious mind (big me) is released and flood your conscious mind with a sense of PANIC, FOREBODING AND DESPAIR.</li>
        <li>If you say you do not like mushrooms, the subconscious mind says to your conscious mind that you do not like mushrooms and you will get indigestion</li>
